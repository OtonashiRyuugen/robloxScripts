**How to Apply Leaderboard**

1. Add a script to ServerScriptService object in the explorer (It is near the bottom)
2. Copy the contents from [LeaderboardSetup.lua](https://github.com/OtonashiRyuugen/robloxScripts/blob/main/Extras/LeaderboardSetup.lua) and paste it into the script we just created.
3. Copy the contents of [hidingSpotsScriptForLeaderboard.lua](https://github.com/OtonashiRyuugen/robloxScripts/blob/main/Extras/hidingSpotsScriptForLeaderboard.lua) and replace the script from the HidingSpots folder.
